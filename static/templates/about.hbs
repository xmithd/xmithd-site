    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is {{full_name}}.
      I am a senior software developer working at <a target="_blank" href="https://mcgill.ca">McGill University</a> in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
      Passionate about building software systems, I enjoy my work at designing, building and maintaining several applications.
      Most of what I develop is related to backend systems using several technologies such as PL/SQL, Grails, Java and NodeJS.
      The "front-facing" software I have developed so far is mostly used by administrative staff and Graduate students. It is built in React.
