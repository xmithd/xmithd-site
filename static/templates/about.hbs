    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am currently a MSc in Computer Science student at the University of Hong Kong. My goal is to update my knowledge and learn more about recent trends and techniques in Computer Science, particularly in data science and AI where my experience is lacking.
    </p>
    <p>Previously, I was a senior software developer working at a public research university in Canada.
      Passionate about building software systems, I enjoy my work at designing, building and maintaining several applications.
      At work, I focused on application development using NodeJS, React, Oracle, Spring Boot and Grails. TypeScript has been really helpful avoiding many bugs in our NodeJS and React code.
      The front-facing applications I have developed are mainly used by administrative staff and Graduate students. One of them is <a href="https://mythesis.mcgill.ca">myThesis</a>.
      In my free time, I like working with lower level languages and tools.
      After plenty of frustrations with large frameworks, I prefer smaller libraries that give me more control on how I want to run an application.
      This site is running on a backend built with Rust ⚙️.
    </p>
    <p>Outside of development, I enjoy</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Studying Chinese Putonghua. I am a beginner.</li>
      <li>Studying Japanese (currently on pause until I get better in Chinese).</li>
      <li>Running. I have run several half marathons. Eventually I would like to try a full marathon.</li>
      <li>Following European football/soccer.
        I follow La Liga, English Premier League and of course The UEFA Champions League.
