    <h1>Welcome to {{site_name}}</h1>
    <p>The goal is to use this site and domain for experiments and small coding projects for myself.
    I will add a very simple blogging platform sometime <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">this summer hopefully!</span> when I have time.</p>
    <p>
      Feel free to browse around. The static site is finally done. (It's always a work in progress in real life). <br />
      </p>
      <p>These are the next steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adding a small database</li>
      <li>Building a very simple blogging engine</li>
      <li>Small WebRTC chat application to learn about WebRTC.</li>
    </ul>
